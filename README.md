# openssl-externalCMake

This is a fork of [Fsu0413/openssl-externalCMake](https://github.com/Fsu0413/openssl-externalCMake).
See the original repo for more information.

The purpose of this fork is to attempt to support newer versions,
because the most recent versions are missing at the time of writing.

Changes:
* A new branch 'main', based on 3.4.1 (the most recent version when the fork was created)
* The new 'main' branch is the default branch of this fork
* Branches 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 have been rebased on this new 'main' branch and renamed openssl-3.0, openssl-3.1, openssl-3.2, openssl-3.3 and openssl-3.4
* Most versions of the 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 series have been tagged,
  as well as the more recent 3.0.x releases
